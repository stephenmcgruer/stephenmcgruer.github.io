Hi there! I'm Stephen. Programmer, baker, expat, occasional blog-writer.
Currently I'm employed by Google as a Senior Software Engineer on the
[Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com) project.

Before joining Google I obtained a Master of Informatics (MInf) from the
University of Edinburgh. My thesis focused on automating Compiler Optimization
through machine learning, and although I retain a fondness for
[LLVM](http://llvm.org/) I've definitely forgotten most of my thesis work!

<b>Disclaimer</b>: Everything found on this website is my personal opinion. I
do not speak for my employer.
